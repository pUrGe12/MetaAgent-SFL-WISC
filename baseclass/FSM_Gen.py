def Generate_FSM(task, agent_dict):
    prompt_template = '''
    You are the designer of a multi-agent system. Given a general task description and a list of agents, you need to generate a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage the process of solving the task.
    
    WARNING: You are good at controlling costs, too many agents and too complex cooperation structure can lead to excessive costs of information exchange
    Each state in the FSM should include:
    1. state_id: A unique identifier for the state
    2. agent_id: The ID of the agent associated with this state
    3. instruction: What the agent should do in this state
    4. is_initial: Boolean indicating if this is the initial state
    5. is_final: Boolean indicating if this is a final state
    6. listener: The agent who will save this state output information in their memory
                 Notice : Make sure the listener covers all related agents. The agents not listed as a listener would not received the information(which may cause the failure of cooperation)
                 Hence, some important milestone like a new version of code/answer should be broadcast all related agentÔºÅ

    The FSM should also include transition functions between states. Each transition function should specify:
    1. from_state: The ID of the state this transition is from
    2. to_state: The ID of the state this transition goes to
    3. condition: A description of the condition that triggers this transition

    Your answer should follow this format:
    Reasoning: <Your step-by-step reasoning process>
    Answer:
    ```json
    {{
      "states": [
        {{
          "state_id": "1",
          "agent_id": "0",
          "instruction": "Perform task X",
          "is_initial": true,
          "is_final": false,
          "listener":["1","2"]
        }},
        ...
      ],
      "transitions": [
        {{
          "from_state": "1",
          "to_state": "2",
          "condition": "If task X is completed successfully"
        }},
        {{
          "from_state": "2",
          "to_state": "1",
          "condition": "If the previous task needs to be re-done."
        }},
        ...
      ]
    }}
    ```

    Rules:
    1. Ensure there is exactly one initial state and at least one final state.
    2. Every non-final state should have at least one outgoing transition.
    3. The FSM should be able to handle loops and complex interactions between agents.
    4. Include a transition to a final state that submits the final answer (use <|submit|> in the instruction).
    5. Make sure all agent_ids in the states correspond to the provided agent_dict.
    6. The transitions should consider as many as possible situations. Which consisit a roadmap for Multi-Agent System in deployment stage.
